This project was created to improve my typescript, learn Nextjs, and Styled Components. I like manipulating data with vscode and javascript more than vanilla excel, so I decided to make a spreadsheet system that does just that. I also use spreadsheets quite a bit at work, often with programs that I need to run on them. The plan is to save scripts to local storage, or have multiple upload buttons to process differerent csv formats. Also, because I frequently create "disposable" workbooks, I think it would also be cool to save workbooks full workbooks in tabs (similiar to browser tabs), or have workbooks with "expiration dates" (workbooks that delete themselves after a certain time)
